===== DESCRIPTION =====

Riccardo Patroni's Thesis -> implementation of an elementary PINN library for solving PDEs over simple hyper-rectangular domains

CONTENT:
- Library -> folder containing the general PINN utilities along with the specific subfolders for the basic and adaptive plugins
- Basic -> folder containing all tests run with the basic PINN core & the relative scripts for their launch, organisation and visualisation
- Adaptive -> folder containing all the experiments run with the adaptive PINN core & the relative scripts for their launch, organisation and visualisation

FILES:
- Launch_Script.py -> run for prompting the training of the models for the relative test
- Inspect_Main.py -> run to visualise a category of trained models
- Organize_Main.py -> run to organise results for the sensitivity analysis related to the basic PINN models
- Result_Main.py -> run to visualise the results for the sensitivity analysis related to the basic PINN models
- Plot_Main.py -> run to visualise the error plots for the convergence analysis related to the basic PINN models
- All other files without a python extension represent an instance of a particular model: these are grouped in their relative test folder
